<p> Many students struggle with creating <strong>a study guide </strong>that is based on their <strong> learning type </strong> and then receives a mark on their test that they’re not happy with. Here are a couple of study guides that are made for the correct learning type, which will help students <strong> effectively learn </strong> for any test, exam, etc.</p> 
<br><h2>Visual Learning</h2>

<h3>Some of the characteristics of visual learners consist of:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Use of pictures and diagrams to help learn a key topic the learner visualizes pictures in their mind while reading </li> 
    <li>Understand the key points of a chart</li>
    <li>Use colour to organize information</li>
</ul>

<p>One way a visual learner should study, is by creating various <strong>charts</strong>, that display the notes they’ve made in class. However, by drawing the information out, it is more likely for visual learners to understand the information better. To make a diagram,<strong> highlighting the key words</strong> in your notes is the best way to start. You can use those keywords in your diagram by labeling key parts of the diagram. For example, if you draw a plant cell on a flash card, and have an arrow pointing towards a key part of the cell, you can have the organelle on the other side and provide a definition of the organelle. Another way many visual learners study is by <strong>colour coding</strong> their notes. For instance, if your studying vocabulary for a specific subject, you may want to use different colour highlighters <strong>to indicate the importance</strong> of the word. Each colour can symbolize the topic or category it falls under.</p>

<p>Use of pictures and diagrams can help a student learn a key topic, as the learner visualizes pictures in their mind while reading, and they are able to understand the key points of a chart.

<h3>Visual Learner Study Guide</h3>
<p>The first part of this study guide is to make a chart, the chart includes the various topics that you have to study for a test, along with the difficulty level of each topic. Identifying the difficulty level will allow one to understand which topics they need to study first. The first step is to divide the information you need to study into 6-10 topics, and then rate the difficulty level of your topics. Now, this makes it easier for creating a study schedule, based on what you think needs to be studied the most. For instance, if a learner has to study 6 topics, but 2 topics are very difficult to learn, the learner would study the challenging topics first. The study schedule consists of how many days the learner thinks they need to study before their test.</p>
<p>Using the techniques of visual learners, the second part of this study guide includes making a chart and a diagram. This part consists of making a chart with terms you need to study, along with the definitions. We also created a visually appealing diagram, using the topic of “Reproduction” as an example. The diagram includes turning key words of a topic into symbols or pictures to help a visual learner understand the main concept of the topic.</p>

<p>The third part of this study guide is most visually appealing, yet it's still effective. This part includes the use of sticky notes and colour. Using Meiosis and Mitosis as our topics, we combined the colour coding and diagram strategies into one study guide. This includes drawing diagrams on a sticky note, then placing those sticky notes on a piece of paper, and then writing the key word that corresponds with the picture. Depending on how many topics you have to study, you can colour code the topics with different colours of sticky notes, this way when you highlighted your notes on paper before, the hightlighted colour matches up with the sitcky note colour. This makes the study guide more clean, organized, and effective.</p>

<p>The last part of this study guide includes all of the strategies we listed before. This part consists of using symbols like bullet points and arrows, along with replacing key words with symbols. Studying a large amount of information can give students stress, but by summarizing the information and replacing some words with symbols, can help a visual learner learn without stress.</p>

<p1>The study guide we’ve made for <strong2> Visual Learners </strong2> consists of all of the techniques these types of learners use. Making <strong> diagrams, charts,<strong3 id="color"> color </strong3> coding, etc.</strong> Based on past experience, this guide is suitable for teenagers, whether it is for studying for an exam, test, or quiz, following this study guide is helpful for these learners. </p1>

<h3>Auditory Learners</h3>

<p>Some auditory learners don’t have a great memory for some things such as memorizing notes right out of a note book, but more so learn better by listening to music. This is actually proven to be a fact, this is because some people learn better by reading their notes to themselves to the beat and or rhythm of a song that they like. Also, rather than repeating one's notes very quickly over and over again some people would rather repeat their notes more slowly and read it back to themselves. Therefore, the people who prefer to read their notes more slowly aren’t considered to be “slow” but more so efficient; then again all people have their own way of studying but for auditory learners, this is a strategy that is efficient for them.

    <h3> Ways to Study using Auditory Learning </h3>
   <ul>
       <li> Listen to music while you read your notes. </li>
       <li> Record yourself saying your study notes and then just play it to yourself. </li>
       <li> Find a text to speech app or website and write your notes into the box, then press play. <br>
               (This method might not sound the best, when you are listening to it) </li>
   </ul>
  <h3> Social Learning </h3>
 
 <p5> One way to learn effectively is to learn with other people, who are also preparing for the same test. Social learning is about learning information by <strong> communicating with others</strong>. For example, you could find a person in the same class as you, and ask questions to each other, fix any errors in answers, and memorize the information by communicating together. For some people, this is a very effective way to learn because it is more exciting than just reading off notes because one can learn something, by talking to a friend and it can help keep retention about the information they learned. Ways to learn socially can be testing someone about the material, reading off to one another, getting tested by someone, etc. A classmate might not be the best learner in class, but by learning with somebody else, they can become motivated and might start wanting to learn/study. </p5>

<h4>Study Guide for Social & Auditorial Learners</h4>
<img src="http://aaspeech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/speech-Bubbles.jpg" width="200" align="right">
<p>Most students rather learn in a fun enviroment, it tends to be more stress free and overall makes it more fun to learn. We have made a study guide that includes all of this! This game is called "Questions Roulette". The learning game is suitable for both auditorial and social learners. The game includes turning your notes into possible test questions, writing them onto flashcards, and playing with your friends. Social learners prefer to communicate regarding a specific topic with others, rather than alone and audtiorial learners prefer to hear information. This game is great combination for both learners. This way auditorial learners are able to practice and hear the correct answer to a question with a friend, which is how social learners prefer to study.</p>
