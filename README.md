<p> Many students struggle with creating <strong>a study guide </strong>that is based on their <strong> learning type </strong> and then receives a mark on their test that they’re not happy with. Here are a couple of study guides that are made for the correct learning type, which will help students <strong> effectively learn </strong> for any test, exam, etc.</p> 
<br> <h2> Visual Learning</h2>


<h3> Some of the characteristics of visual learners consist of:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Use of pictures and diagrams to help learn a key topic the learner visualizes pictures in their mind while reading </li> 
    <li>Understand the key points of a chart</li>
    <li>Use colour to organize information</li>
</ul>
<p>One way a visual learner should study, is by creating various <strong>charts</strong>, that display the notes they’ve made in class. However, by drawing the information out, it is more likely for visual learners to understand the information better. To make a diagram,<strong> highlighting the key words</strong> in your notes is the best way to start. You can use those keywords in your diagram by labeling key parts of the diagram. For example, if you draw a plant cell on a flash card, and have an arrow pointing towards a key part of the cell, you can have the organelle on the other side and provide a definition of the organelle. Another way many visual learners study is by <strong>colour coding</strong> their notes. For instance, if your studying vocabulary for a specific subject, you may want to use different colour highlighters <strong>to indicate the importance</strong> of the word. Each colour can symbolize the topic or category it falls under.</p>

<p1>The study guide we’ve made for <strong2> Visual Learners </strong2> consists of all of the techniques these types of learners use. Making <strong> diagrams, charts,<strong3 id="color"> color </strong3> coding, etc.</strong> Based on past experience, this guide is suitable for teenagers, whether it is for studying for an exam, test, or quiz, following this study guide is helpful for these learners. </p1>


   

<h3>Auditory Learners</h3>

<p>Some auditory learners don’t have a great memory for some things such as memorizing notes right out of a not book, but more so learn better by listening to music. This is actually proven to be a fact, this is because some people learn better by reading their notes to themselves to the beat and or rhythm of a song that they like. Also, rather than repeating one's notes very quickly over and over again some people would rather repeat their notes more slowly and read it back to themselves. Therefore, the people who prefer to read their notes more slowly aren’t considered to be “slow” but more so efficient; then again all people have their own way of studying but for auditory learners, this is a strategy that is efficient for them.
<p>
    <h3> Ways to Study using Auditory Learning </h3>
   <ul>
       <li> Listen to music while you read your notes. </li>
       <li> Record yourself saying your study notes and then just play it to yourself. </li>
       <li> Find a text to speech app or website and write your notes into the box, then press play. <br>
           (This method might not sound the best, when you are listening to it) </li>
   </ul>
       
 <h3> Social Learning </h3>
 
 <p5> One way to learn effectively is to learn with other people, who are also preparing for the same test. Social learning is about learning information by <strong> communicating with others</strong>. For example, you could find a person in the same class as you, and ask questions to each other, fix any errors in answers, and memorize the information by communicating together. For some people, this is a very effective way to learn because it is more exciting than just reading off notes because one can learn something, by talking to a friend and it can help keep retention about the information they learned. Ways to learn socially can be testing someone about the material, reading off to one another, getting tested by someone, etc. A classmate might not be the best learner in class, but by learning with somebody else, they can become motivated and might start wanting to learn/study. </p5>
